I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm<span id='line_1'>[&nbsp&nbsp1]</span><br>
increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash<span id='line_2'>[&nbsp&nbsp2]</span><br>
over my head.  It was echoed from Saleve, the Juras, and the Alps of<span id='line_3'>[&nbsp&nbsp3]</span><br>
Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the<span id='line_4'>[&nbsp&nbsp4]</span><br>
lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant<span id='line_5'>[&nbsp&nbsp5]</span><br>
every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself<span id='line_6'>[&nbsp&nbsp6]</span><br>
from the preceding flash.  The storm, as is often the case in<span id='line_7'>[&nbsp&nbsp7]</span><br>
Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens.  The<span id='line_8'>[&nbsp&nbsp8]</span><br>
most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the<span id='line_9'>[&nbsp&nbsp9]</span><br>
lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of<span id='line_10'>[&nbsp&nbsp10]</span><br>
Copet.  Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another<span id='line_11'>[&nbsp&nbsp11]</span><br>
darkened and sometimes disclosed the Mole, a peaked mountain to the<span id='line_12'>[&nbsp&nbsp12]</span><br>
east of the lake.<span id='line_13'>[&nbsp&nbsp13]</span>
