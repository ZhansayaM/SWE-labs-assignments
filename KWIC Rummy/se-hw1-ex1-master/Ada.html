Who Was Ada Lovelace?<span id='line_2'>[&nbsp&nbsp2]</span><br>
The daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace — better known as "Ada Lovelace" — showed her gift for mathematics at an early age. She translated an article on an invention by Charles Babbage, and added her own comments. Because she introduced many computer concepts, Lovelace is considered the first computer programmer. She died on November 27, 1852.<span id='line_3'>[&nbsp&nbsp3]</span><br>

Early Years<span id='line_5'>[&nbsp&nbsp5]</span><br>
Ada Lovelace, born as Augusta Ada Byron on December 10, 1815, was the only legitimate child of the famous poet Lord George Gordon Byron. Lord Byron's marriage to Lovelace's mother, Lady Anne Isabella Milbanke Byron, was not a happy one. Lady Byron separated from her husband only weeks after their daughter was born. A few months later, Lord Byron left England, and Lovelace never saw her father again. He died in Greece when Ada was 8 years old.<span id='line_6'>[&nbsp&nbsp6]</span><br>

Lovelace had an unusual upbringing for an aristocratic girl in the mid-1800s. At her mother's insistence, tutors taught her mathematics and science. Such challenging subjects were not standard fare for women at the time, but her mother believed that engaging in rigorous studies would prevent Lovelace from developing her father's moody and unpredictable temperament. Lovelace was also forced to lie still for extended periods of time because her mother believed it would help her develop self-control.<span id='line_8'>[&nbsp&nbsp8]</span>
